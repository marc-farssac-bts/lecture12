# Lecture 12: Framer X class Project
This is our Lecture12 exercise where we are going to work with our colleagues in a shared common project, each of us creating a Frame in our working branch.

## Exercise objective
As explained in the classroom, students will clone this repository and create a Frame in a branch branched from Master. The branch they create will be named in accordance to the following pattern: surname_TwoWordsAboutTheFrame

for example, one of the branches is farssac_FrameTablet, another one is farssac_ExerciseDescription, etc.

![branches](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60255871/77063325-cad70700-69dd-11ea-925f-c9a656e028c6.png)

once they have created the branch and checked it out, they can open FramerX and start creating their Frame. Now and then they can commit their changes.

At the end of their Frame design they shall push their commits to the origin repository.

Some issues may happen during the course of the exercises. Students must be very careful when commiting and pushing since this is a shared repostitory / project with the rest of the group and any mistakes will affect the other. Nevertheless, different types of issues are expected as a result of this first exercise working remotely in a team of 20 students distributed at their homes in a shared Framer X project.

## Exercise result

The following is the result of mergin two branches into the workspace. If things go well, at the end of the exercise we should have 20 frames and 20 branches created by the students of the class.
